# transactions-analyzer

The system will be Initialised with an input file in CSV format containing a list of transaction records.
Once initialised, the system should report the total number of transactions and the average transaction value for a specific merchant in a specific date range.
An additional requirement is that, if a transaction record has a REVERSAL transaction, then it should not be included in the computed statistics, even if the reversing transaction is outside of the requested date range.
